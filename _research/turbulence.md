In the field of Turbulence, my research has focused on the identification on linear and nonlinear mechanisms in wall-bounded shear flows. My work pioneered
the use of quasilinear approximations as an interventional tool to suppress certain triadic nonlinear interactions like the energy cascade and inverse energy 
transfer in the near-wall region. In particular, I applied the generalized quasilinear (GQL) approximation (Marston et al., PRL 2016) to turbulent channel 
flow at high friction Reynolds numbers (Reτ≃1700), with emphasis on the energy transfer in the streamwise wavenumber space. The flow is decomposed into low- 
and high-streamwise-wavenumber groups, the former of which is solved by considering the full nonlinear equations whereas the latter is obtained from the 
linearized equations around the former. I found that the QL model (one streamwise mode) exhibits a considerably reduced multi-scale behaviour at the given 
moderately high Reynolds number. This is improved significantly by the GQL approximation which incorporates only a few more streamwise Fourier modes into 
the low-wavenumber group, and it reasonably well recovers the distance-from-the-wall scaling in the turbulence statistics and spectra. I proposed that the 
energy transfer from the low- to the high-wavenumber group in the GQL approximation, referred to as the ‘scattering’ mechanism, depends on the neutrally 
stable leading Lyapunov spectrum of the linearized equations for the high-wavenumber group.

Based on the GQL approximation, I have also proposed a type of decomposition into spanwise Fourier modes that leads to a nonlinear low-wavenumber group 
that supports the self-sustaining process within the given integral length scales, while the linearized high-wavenumber group is not able to do so, unlike 
the GQL models proposed until date, which place a minimal mathematical description for the self-sustaining process across all integral scales. Despite not 
being able to support the self-sustaining process in the high-wavenumber group, these GQL models are found to reproduce some key statistical features in 
the high-wavenumber group solely through the ‘scattering’ mechanism proposed by previous studies. 

The GQL approximation is an interesting physics-based reduced-order model that has captured the attention of several groups working in Turbulence. There is
scope for extension of this work into two

I use the nature of the GQL approximation to propose numerical experiments suppressing certain triadic nonlinear interactions to study scale interactions 
comprehensively. If you have new ideas on the matter, I am more than happy to collaborate!

> Do rebels target civilians as part of the process of establishing control in their territories? This research note shows that transition periods after rebels gain territorial control are remarkably violent for civilians. Speaking to the civilian victimization and rebel governance literature, we investigate the immediate time period after rebels successfully capture and hold territory. We argue that rebels use violence to gain compliance in newly captured territories until they are able to build up local capacities and institutions for peaceful governance. To test this argument, we draw on methodological advances in integrating event data and combine multiple datasets to study patterns of violence perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone from 1997-2001. The findings of our spatiotemporal analysis show that civilian targeting increases in the period after rebels capture territory from the government compared to areas without territorial takeover, suggesting that life under the roof of rebels is initially more dangerous for civilians.
