Turbulence dynamics

In the field of Turbulence, my research has focused on the identification on linear and nonlinear mechanisms in wall-bounded shear flows. My work pioneered
the use of quasilinear approximations as an interventional tool to suppress certain triadic nonlinear interactions like the energy cascade and inverse energy 
transfer in the near-wall region. In particular, I applied the generalized quasilinear (GQL) approximation (Marston et al., PRL 2016) to turbulent channel 
flow at high friction Reynolds numbers (Reτ≃1700), with emphasis on the energy transfer in the streamwise wavenumber space. The flow is decomposed into low- 
and high-streamwise-wavenumber groups, the former of which is solved by considering the full nonlinear equations whereas the latter is obtained from the 
linearized equations around the former. I found that the QL model (one streamwise mode) exhibits a considerably reduced multi-scale behaviour at the given 
moderately high Reynolds number. This is improved significantly by the GQL approximation which incorporates only a few more streamwise Fourier modes into 
the low-wavenumber group, and it reasonably well recovers the distance-from-the-wall scaling in the turbulence statistics and spectra. I proposed that the 
energy transfer from the low- to the high-wavenumber group in the GQL approximation, referred to as the ‘scattering’ mechanism, depends on the neutrally 
stable leading Lyapunov spectrum of the linearized equations for the high-wavenumber group.

Based on the GQL approximation, I have also proposed a type of decomposition into spanwise Fourier modes that leads to a nonlinear low-wavenumber group 
that supports the self-sustaining process within the given integral length scales, while the linearized high-wavenumber group is not able to do so, unlike 
the GQL models proposed until date, which place a minimal mathematical description for the self-sustaining process across all integral scales. Despite not 
being able to support the self-sustaining process in the high-wavenumber group, these GQL models are found to reproduce some key statistical features in 
the high-wavenumber group solely through the ‘scattering’ mechanism proposed by previous studies. 

The GQL approximation is an interesting physics-based reduced-order model that has captured the attention of several groups working in Turbulence. There is
scope for extension of this work into two

I use the nature of the GQL approximation to propose numerical experiments suppressing certain triadic nonlinear interactions to study scale interactions 
comprehensively. If you have new ideas on the matter, I am more than happy to collaborate!

> Do rebels target civilians as part of the process of establishing control in their territories? This research note shows that transition periods after rebels gain territorial control are remarkably violent for civilians. Speaking to the civilian victimization and rebel governance literature, we investigate the immediate time period after rebels successfully capture and hold territory. We argue that rebels use violence to gain compliance in newly captured territories until they are able to build up local capacities and institutions for peaceful governance. To test this argument, we draw on methodological advances in integrating event data and combine multiple datasets to study patterns of violence perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone from 1997-2001. The findings of our spatiotemporal analysis show that civilian targeting increases in the period after rebels capture territory from the government compared to areas without territorial takeover, suggesting that life under the roof of rebels is initially more dangerous for civilians.

> Research in political science has shown that UN peacekeeping operations are an important tool for ending civil war violence. However, much less is known about how UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization. Given that civilians bear the primary costs of intrastate conflict,  understanding how international actors can contribute to the resolution of violence affecting them is a pressing concern. How does the presence of UN peacekeepers affect civilian victimization? We address this question by offering a straightforward empirical test of how UN peacekeeping patrols affect the likelihood that there will be violence against civilians. We build on the existing literature and established practices of peacekeeping to argue that peacekeepers deter violence against violence. To test our argument, we examine the case of Mail, the site of large-scale communal violence managed by UN peacekeepers since  2013. We employ a Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design (GRDD) around the border of Mali and Burkina Faso to estimate the causal effect of deploying peacekeepers to an area with growing communal tensions. Ultimately, our research provides robust causal evidence that UN peacekeeping works at the local level to protect civilians.

> Despite the wealth of academic research on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations, we know remarkably little about the causes of violence against peacekeepers. The dramatic increase in peacekeeper casualties over the past decade make this omission particularly problematic. This article demonstrates that violence against peacekeepers stems from strategic motivations. Peacekeepers in multidimensional PKOs serve as substitute providers of governance and security, working to bolster perceived state capacity and legitimacy in areas where the government cannot send its own forces. Insurgents target peacekeepers in expectation of a PKO unit’s capacity to win over the support of local civilians. We argue that insurgents rely on three primary heuristics to predict the downstream efficacy of peacekeeping forces: personnel composition, peacekeeper nationality, and local levels of insurgent control. We test our theory using an original dataset of geocoded UN multidimensional peacekeeping deployments peacekeeping deployments. Using primary documents sourced directly from the UN covering 10 multidimensional peacekeeping operations from 1999-2018, we present comprehensive time-series data on UN peacekeeper deployment location. We ﬁnd preliminary evidence that peacekeepers are targeted because of their cultural similarity with noncombatants and, in some cases, because they patrol areas where insurgents have political control.
