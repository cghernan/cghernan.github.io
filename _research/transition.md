I am interested in the receptivity of high-speed boundary layers, the process in which external perturbations (e.g. oncoming sound waves, free-stream 
turbulence and entropy, and localized or distributed roughness) excite instability modes. These intrinsic instabilities may amplify to attain amplitudes 
far above those of the external disturbances, eventually leading the boundary layer to turbulence. Instability modes that may arise depend on the Mach 
number. In the subsonic regime, they are Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves, which have a viscous origin. In the super- and hypersonic regimes, there exist 
multiple families of modes (Mack, 1984) including the so-called first Mack modes, which are continuation of T-S modes into the compressible regime, and 
the second Mack modes, which are essentially inviscid.

I have worked on two new receptivity mechanisms. The first is new, involving the interaction of two acoustic waves and operating in a boundary layer over 
a smooth wall. The second involves the interaction between an acoustic wave and the steady perturbation induced by a wavy wall. Both interactions generate 
a forcing in resonance with a neutral Tollmien–Schlichting (T–S) wave. The latter is thus excited near the lower branch of the neutral curve, and 
subsequently undergoes exponential amplification. The two receptivity processes with the acoustic waves on the triple-deck scale are found to be much more 
effective compared with those involving usual sound waves, with the coupling coefficient being greater by a factor of O(R^1/4) and O(R^1/8) in the 
sound–sound and sound–roughness interactions, respectively.

I am currently working on other receptivity mechanisms pertaining to high-speed boundary layers, and am looking to compare the high-Reynolds-number
asymptotics results to numerical simulations and experiments. Receptivity has received far less attention than Instability, and there are a number of
low-hanging fruits to be collected in this area. If you are an asymptotician, a numericist or an experimentalist, feel free to reach out!
