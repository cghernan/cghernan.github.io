As an educator, I am deeply committed to fostering an environment of intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and collaborative learning. My teaching 
philosophy is rooted in the belief that education is a transformative process that goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a journey of 
exploration and development.

At Stanford, I have been a teaching assistant for the Low-Order Modeling for Turbulent Flows course. Because of my interdisciplinary background (applied 
mathematics, physics of fluids and engineering), I could show students examples drawn from my own research â€“ there is no better way to show the 
relevance of the methods they are studying. It is also my objective to develop new specialized courses, ranging from boundary layer asymptotics to 
computational turbulence to artificial intelligence applied to fluid dynamics.

At the undergraduate level, I have taught Complex Analysis, Infinitesimal Calculus and Methods for Data Science (Reinforcement Learning), during my time at Imperial College as a teaching assistant, 
delivering lectures as well as marking homework assessments and final exams.
 
At the postgraduate level, I am interested in teaching fluid mechanics and asymptotic methods courses. In the field of Applied Mathematics, it is crucial 
for students to apply their mathematical knowledge to real-world problems, so the assessments must be designed along this direction.
