As an aspiring educator in the field of Applied Mathematics, I am deeply committed to fostering an environment of intellectual curiosity, critical thinking,
 and collaborative learning. My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that education is a transformative process that goes beyond the mere transfer of
 information; it is a journey of exploration and development.

At Stanford, I have been a teaching assistant for the Low-Order Modeling for Turbulent Flows course. Because of my interdisciplinary background (applied 
mathematics, physics of fluids and engineering, I could show students examples drawn from my own research â€“ there is no better way to show them the 
relevance of the methods they are studying. It is also my objective to develop new specialized courses, ranging from boundary layer asymptotics to 
computational turbulence to artificial intelligence applied to fluid dynamics.

At the undergraduate level, I have taught Complex Analysis and Methods for Data Science, during my time at Imperial College as a teaching assistant, 
delivering lectures as well as marking homework assessments and final exams.
 
At the postgraduate level, I am interested in fluid mechanics courses, and in asymptotic methods. In the field of Applied Mathematics, it is crucial for 
students to apply their mathematical knowledge to real-world problems, so the assessments must be designed along this direction.
