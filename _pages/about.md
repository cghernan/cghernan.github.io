Hola! I am Research Fellow in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University.
I work at the intersection of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence, 
specializing in the construction of physics-informed reduced-order models for their use as ‘digital twins’ in real-time engineering applications. 
These models make effective use of deep artificial neural networks to break the curse of 
dimensionality associated to the high dimensionality of systems described by partial differential equations.

I read Aerospace Engineering ([U. Sevilla](https://www.us.es/), 2014) and Fluid Mechanics ([Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), 2015) 
before moving on to obtain my PhD in Applied Mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (2021). I also interned at 
[The Von Kármán Institute](https://www.vki.ac.be/), [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/) and was a Research Scientist at the [French Atomic Energy Commission]
(https://www.cea.fr/) in 2016. Before my current appointment, I was a CTR Research Fellow in the [Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu/)
 at Stanford University.

I have made a key contribution in the field of laminar to turbulent transition elucidating a new acoustic receptivity mechanism for instabilities 
in high-speed boundary layers. In the field of Turbulence, my research has focused on the identification of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in 
wall-bounded turbulent shear flows; my work pioneered the use of quasilinear approximations as an interventional tool to suppress certain triadic 
nonlinear interactions like the energy cascade and inverse energy transfer in the near-wall region. 

The theoretical underpinnings developed during my PhD have the potential to be extended to other flow regimes and conditions, accounting for massive savings in computation time (costly partial differential equations replaced by simple chains of algebraic operations).
