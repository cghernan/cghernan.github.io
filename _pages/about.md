Hola! I am Research Fellow in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University. I work at the intersection of Computational Fluid 
Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence, specializing in the construction of physics-informed reduced-order models for their use as ‘digital twins’ in 
real-time engineering applications. These models make effective use of deep artificial neural networks to break the curse of dimensionality associated to 
the high dimensionality of systems described by PDEs.

I read Aerospace Engineering ([U. Sevilla](https://www.us.es/), 2014) and Fluid Mechanics ([Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), 2015) 
before moving on to obtain my PhD in Applied Mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (2021). I also interned at 
[The Von Kármán Institute](https://www.vki.ac.be/), [the French Aerospace Laboratory](https://www.onera.fr/) and was a Research Scientist at the 
[French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/) in 2016. Before my current appointment, I was a CTR Research Fellow in the 
[Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

I am an engineer and an applied mathematician with a strong analytical, quantitative and computing background. I am advocate for open-source software and
try to release every code I produce for my research, including scientific codes to perform numerical simulation of PDEs (e.g. Navier-Stokes equations), 
model-order reduction and post-processing tools of my own (I have an obsession with visualizing results properly and meaningfully). In the last years,
I have become increasingly interested in the use of AI for Science and now you can usually find me exploring Reinforcement Learning architectures for their
use in problems in mathematics and the physical sciences, mostly on PyTorch. 

AI is set to transform the way we do Science, and I am on the look out for intellectual challenges in this field. If you felt inspired by my research and
have ideas that you want to discuss, I am always seeking collaborations - please get in touch!
