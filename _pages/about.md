Hola! I am Research Fellow in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University.
I work at the intersection of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence, 
specializing in the construction of physics-informed reduced-order models for their use as ‘digital twins’ in real-time engineering applications. 
These models make effective use of deep artificial neural networks to break the curse of 
dimensionality associated to the high dimensionality of systems described by partial differential equations.

I read Aerospace Engineering ([U. Sevilla](https://www.us.es/), 2014) and Fluid Mechanics ([Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), 2015) before moving on to obtain my PhD in Applied Mathematics 
from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (2021). I also interned at [The Von Kármán Institute](https://www.vki.ac.be/), [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/) and 
was a Research Scientist at the [French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/) in 2016. Before my current appointment, I was a CTR Research Fellow 
in the [Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.
