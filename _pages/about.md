Hola! I am Research Fellow in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University.
I work at the intersection of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence, 
specializing in the construction of physics-informed reduced-order models for their use as ‘digital twins’ in real-time engineering applications. 
These models make effective use of deep artificial neural networks to break the curse of dimensionality associated to the high dimensionality 
of systems described by partial differential equations.

I read Aerospace Engineering ([U. Sevilla](https://www.us.es/), 2014) and Fluid Mechanics ([Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), 2015) 
before moving on to obtain my PhD in Applied Mathematics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (2021). I also interned at 
[The Von Kármán Institute](https://www.vki.ac.be/), [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/) and was a Research Scientist at the 
[French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/) in 2016. Before my current appointment, I was a CTR Research Fellow in the 
[Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

I have made a key contribution in the field of laminar to turbulent transition elucidating a new acoustic receptivity mechanism for instabilities 
in high-speed boundary layers. In the field of Turbulence, my research has focused on the identification of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in 
wall-bounded turbulent shear flows; my work pioneered the use of quasilinear approximations as an interventional tool to suppress certain triadic 
nonlinear interactions like the energy cascade and inverse energy transfer in the near-wall region. 

I currently research how to best combine traditional projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) and machine learning architectures like artificial 
neural networks (ANNs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs) to mitigate the Kolmogorov barrier to reducibility of parametric and/or highly nonlinear, 
high-dimensional, physics-based models. The main objective of this concept is to reduce the dimensionality of the online approximation of the solution 
beyond what is achievable using affine and quadratic approximation manifolds, while maintaining accuracy. In contrast to previous approaches that exploited 
one form or another of machine learning, the training of the ANN/GP part does not involve data whose dimension scales with that of the high-dimensional 
model; and the resulting PROM-ANN/GP can be efficiently hyperreduced using any well-established hyperreduction method. Hence, unlike many other ANN-based 
model order reduction approaches, the PROM-ANN/GP concept should be practical for large-scale and industry-relevant computational problems. The concept will 
demonstrate the computational tractability of its offline stage and the superior wall clock time performance of its online stage for a large-scale, 
parametric, two-dimensional, model problem that is representative of shock-dominated unsteady flow problems.
