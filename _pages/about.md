Hola! I am Research Fellow in the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University.
I work at the intersection of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence, 
specializing in the construction of physics-informed reduced-order models for their use as ‘digital twins’ in real-time engineering applications. 
These models make effective use of deep artificial neural networks to break the curse of 
dimensionality associated to the high dimensionality of systems described by partial differential equations.

I read Aerospace Engineering (U. Sevilla, 2014) and Fluid Mechanics ([Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), 2015) before moving on to obtain my PhD in Applied Mathematics 
from [Imperial College London]( (2021). I also interned at [The Von Kármán Institute](https://www.vki.ac.be/), [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/) and 
was a Research Scientist at the [French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/) in 2016. Before my current appointment, I was a CTR Research Fellow 
in the [Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.



earned my PhD in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
BA in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) in the
*American Political Science Review*, *International Studies Quarterly*,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets. This
[research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence
using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial
analysis, and big data. I have [taught](teaching) quantitative methodology and
international relations, and am a certified instructor with
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
